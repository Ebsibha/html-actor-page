<p> Certainly! Tamil actor Thalapathy Vijay recently announced the formation of his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK). His party aims for “fundamental political change” with a transparent, caste-free, and corruption-free administration. Vijay’s move comes after his fan club, Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, approved the party’s formation in Chennai. Although the TVK won’t contest the 2024 general elections, they plan to participate in the 2026 assembly elections12. Vijay, known for his successful film career spanning over three decades, has acted in over 65 films and is among the highest-paid actors in India3. Exciting times</p>
